# CrocTestRun
This is my test run level of Croc Legend of the Gobbos. Croc related assets were made by members in the community compiled by Was A Horse. He gave me permission to continue this fan game under my other alias Sternosaur. This is my own version of the first level with a different twist. I have plans to faithfully recreate the entire first world of Croc Legend of the Gobbos but first there are several things that I need to learn and I would like to bring this over to Unreal Engine 5. Please enjoy my test run level of Croc! https://was-a-horse.itch.io/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-level-1-fan-remake I do not feel comfortable advertising this or relaunching it on itch.io officially until I actually have something substantial to show off.
